Specific Objectives

Development and Integration of a Robust Medical Data Management System
The first objective of the project is to create an intuitive user interface that allows doctors to efficiently manage patient data. 
This will include functions for adding, updating, deleting, and viewing medical information, ensuring that the patient management process is comprehensive and accessible.

Implementation of Radiology Request and Reception Functionalities
Another crucial objective is to facilitate the process of requesting and receiving radiological examinations.
The system will enable doctors to create and send radiology requests, receive, and view results in a standardized format, streamlining the medical workflow and reducing waiting times.

Adding Digital Signatures and Generating Medical Reports
The application will include options for adding electronic signatures to medical documents, such as radiological results, and for generating reports in PDF format, which can then be sent directly to patients. 
This will ensure compliance with medical documentation regulations and improve the security and authenticity of information.

Automated Tumor Segmentation and Classification
A central aspect of the project is the development of an artificial intelligence module for the automatic segmentation and classification of radiological images.
This module will identify and delineate regions of interest, such as tumors, and classify images based on the presence or absence of pathological formations, thus providing crucial support in the diagnostic process.

Automatic Measurement of Tumor Dimensions
The application will also include functionalities for the automatic measurement of the dimensions of identified tumors in images, such as their diameter. 
This will allow for precise monitoring of tumor evolution throughout treatment, contributing to the assessment of therapeutic intervention efficacy.
